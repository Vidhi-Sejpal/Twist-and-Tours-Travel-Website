                            The idea is to feel young at heart ! As long as you feel the same, hop along.
                            Generally, the agent band for group departures remains 18 years and above. Group members less than 18 years of age are welcome to join the tour but only with a family member that will act as their guardian whilst on tour. Aside from that, no age requirements at all!

                            While you are in Delhi, a metro ride is the best mode of conveyance. While there is no shortage of cabs, but Delhi's traffic can get pretty unpredictable.
